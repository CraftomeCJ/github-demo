Files and directories in the template directory whose name do not start with a dot will be copied to the $GIT_DIR after it is created.

The template directory will be one of the following (in order):

the argument given with the --template option;

the contents of the $GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR environment variable;

the init.templateDir configuration variable; or

the default template directory: /usr/share/git-core/templates.

The default template directory includes some directory structure, suggested "exclude patterns" (see gitignore[5]), and sample hook files.

The sample hooks are all disabled by default. To enable one of the sample hooks rename it by removing its .sample suffix.

See githooks[5] for more general info on hook execution.
